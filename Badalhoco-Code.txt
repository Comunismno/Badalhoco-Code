Badalhoco Code - How to write Worse
Intro:
Many years ago, a book named Clean Code was released but that book is full of bullshit, I am writing this to prove the author of the book wrong, he, the king of Sweden and the entire scientific community (adapted from morbius)
1- Chapter, Why
Why not?
2- Chapter, How
There are many things that you can do to deoptimize your code, where I call them deoptimization rules.
1- No loops, that includes While loops, for loops or other kinds of loop
2- No switch cases or match cases
3- Variables only should have 2 letters maximum
4- Variables are declared as the code runs, not in the beginning
5- Only use Garbage Collector Languages, even to write performance intensive Software, I recommend using html
6- ALWAYS copy and paste internet code
END
